 1.Dividing two integers results in integer division---any  fractional part of the calculation is truncated(i.e., Lost). To avoid this you can use the Point or Double , also Bigdecimal.

2.Nesting one control statement within another-one control statement appears inside another.
   Control statement stacking- connect the end point of one statement to the entry point of another.

 Counter controlled repetition works for integers 0-100, This technique uses a variable called counter (or control variable) to control the number of times a set of statements will execute.
   Sentinel-controlled repetition is often called indefinite repetition because the number of repetitions is not known before the loop begins executing.
     One way to solve this problem is to use a special value called a sentinel value (also called a signal value, a dummy value or a flag value) to indicate "end of data entry."
   The user can input grades until all legitimate numbers are entered.
